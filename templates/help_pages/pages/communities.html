  {% blocktrans %}
  A Community is a group of users. A Community can be based on an organization, hobby, physical location, affiliation or any other common interest. Think of a Subreddit or Facebook group, but one where the group is completely isolated from other groups - so anything you post on that group, stays safely inside that group.
  {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<h5 id="starting-a-community">{% trans "Starting a Community" %}</h5>
<div class="divider"></div>
<p>
  {% blocktrans %}
  If you are self-hosting please refer to <a href="">the instructions on how to create a new community [LINK REQUIRED]</a>. Otherwise you will need to contact the site admins of your LocalHub host to create a community for you.
  {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<h5 id="joining-a-community">{% trans "Joining a Community" %}</h5>
<div class="divider"></div>
<p>
  {% blocktrans %}
  There are two ways to join a Community (unless you have been assigned as a founding member by a site admin when setting up the Community). You can be sent an invite, or send a request to the Community Admins to join the Community. Details for Admins on managing invites and join requests are covered in the help page on <a href="">Memberships [LINK REQUIRED]</a>; this section is for prospective members wanting to join a Community.
  {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<h6 id="join-requests">{% trans "Join Requests" %}</h6>
<div class="divider"></div>
<p>
  {% blocktrans %}
  Once you have signed into Localhub, you can apply to join any public Community without needing an invite first. Just click on the link on the <a href="{{ home_page_url }}">home page</a> and confirm you wish to send a request. An email will be sent to the Community <a href="">Admins [LINK REQUIRED]</a>. Once they approve - or reject - your application, you should receive an email in response. If you are accepted, you will automatically become a member of the Community.
  {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<h6 id="invites">{% trans "Invites" %}</h6>
<div class="divider"></div>
<p>
  {% blocktrans %}
  An <a href="#">Admin [LINK REQUIRED]</a> may send you an invite if they know your email address. You should receive an email with an invite link: if you click on the link you will automatically be added as a new member of the Community. Alternatively you may choose to reject the invite.
  {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<h5 id="leaving-a-community">{% trans "Leaving a Community" %}</h5>
<p>
  {% blocktrans %}
  To leave a Community permanently, first click on the <a href="{{ user_update_url }}">My Settings</a> link in the Sidebar, then select the <a href="{{ community_leave_url }}">Leave Community</a> link in the settings Sidebar. Once you have left this Community you can only rejoin by sending a join request or accepting an invite.
  {% endblocktrans %}
</p>
<p>
  {% blocktrans %}
  Your content - posts, photos, events as well as comments and private messages sent to other members - will not be visible to other members, but will not be deleted. You should delete any content before you leave, or request a <a href="">Moderator [LINK REQUIRED]</a> or <a href="">Admin [LINK REQUIRED]</a> do so. Remember that if you <a href="">delete your account [LINK REQUIRED]</a> completely, all your content, across all Communities, will be permanently deleted.
  {% endblocktrans %}
</p>
<div class="divider"></div>

<h5 id="public-and-private-communities">{% trans "Public and private Communities" %}</h5>
<p>
  {% blocktrans %}
  Content published on public Communities is open to the world. Content published in private Communities is only available to members of that Community. Admins can change this setting in the <a data-turbolinks="false" href="#community-settings">Community Settings</a> page.
  {% endblocktrans %}
</p>
<div class="divider"></div>

<h5 id="local-network">{% trans "Local network" %}</h5>
<p>
  {% blocktrans %}
  The <a href="{{ community_list_url }}">Local Network</a> lists all Communities available on this host. Public Communities are always visible. Private Communities are only shown if you are a member of these Communities. You can also search for a Community using the search field at the top of the page.
  {% endblocktrans %}
</p>
<div class="divider"></div>

<h5 id="community-settings">{% trans "Community settings" %} <span class="chip">{% trans "Admins" %}</span></h5>
<p>
  {% blocktrans %}
  The <a href="{{ community_update_url }}">Community Settings</a> link is located in the default Sidebar. The Community Settings page allows you to change a number of settings such as the name and logo of your Community, the description, terms and conditions, and some rules about membership and posting content. More detailed information on managing Community memberships can be found <a href="">here [LINK REQUIRED]</a>.
  {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<h6 id="name-tagline-and-description">{% trans "Name, tagline and description" %}</h6>
<div class="divider"></div>
<p>
  {% blocktrans %}
  You can set the name of your Community, the tagline (which appears in the <a data-turbolinks="false" href="#local-network">Local Network</a>) and the full page description here. The description, if available, will be linked to at the bottom of the default Sidebar. You can use <a href="">Markdown [LINK REQUIRED]</a> in the description. The name of the Community will appear in the Local Network and the top left of the Navbar, unless replaced with a logo (see below).
  {% endblocktrans %}
</p>


<h6 id="community-logo">{% trans "Community logo" %}</h6>
<div class="divider"></div>
<p>
  {% blocktrans %}
  You can upload a company logo, which will replace the name of the Community in the top left of the Navbar. The logo should be a PNG or JPEG file and will be resized to a max width/height of 100 pixels. An aspect ratio of 16/9 probably works best in terms of layout.
  {% endblocktrans %}
</p>


<h6 id="terms-and-conditions">{% trans "Terms and conditions" %}</h6>
<div class="divider"></div>
<p>
  {% blocktrans %}
  The <em>Terms</em> field should include all terms and conditions you wish to apply to the Community. You can use <a href="">Markdown [LINK REQUIRED]</a> here. If you provide terms, a link will be added to the page in the default Sidebar.
  {% endblocktrans %}
</p>


<h6 id="public-private">{% trans "Public" %}</h6>
<div class="divider"></div>
<p>
  {% blocktrans %}
  Determines if the Community is <a data-turbolinks="false" href="#public-and-private-communities">public</a>. Otherwise it is <strong>private</strong>.
  {% endblocktrans %}
</p>


<h6 id="content-sensitive-tags">{% trans "Content sensitive tags" %}</h6>
<div class="divider"></div>
<p>
  {% blocktrans %}
  By default, <a href="">sensitive content is hidden from users [LINK REQUIRED]</a>. This is managed in the Community Settings by determining which tags are considered "sensitive". For example, if you add <em>#nsfw</em> to the list of sensitive tags in the Settings, any post, event or photo with an <em>#nsfw</em> tag in the description will automatically be considered sensitive and the post will be hidden.
  {% endblocktrans %}
</p>


<h6 id="blacklisted-emails">{% trans "Blacklisted emails" %}</h6>
<div class="divider"></div>
<p>
  {% blocktrans %}
  You can block <a data-turbolinks="false" href="#join-requests">join requests</a> from individual email addresses or entire domains in the two fields <em>Blacklisted email addresses</em> and <em>Blacklisted email domains</em> respectively. Users with matching email addresses will not be able to send a request to join your community. For example, if you set <em>gmail.com</em> under <em>Blacklisted email domains</em>, a user with the email address "someone@gmail.com" will be blocked from sending a join request.
